signet default loader
=====================

:mod:`signet <signet.command.build_signet>` comes with a default loader written in c++. The
heirarchy for the loader is::

    signet.command/
    |-- lib/
    |   |-- sha1.cpp            -- sha1 calculator
    |   |-- sha1.h
    |   |-- verifytrust.cpp     -- windows pe verifier
    |   |-- verifytrust.h
    |
    |-- static/
    |   |-- app.ico             -- windows default icon
    |
    |-- templates/
    |   |-- loader.cpp          -- loader c++ code
    |   |-- loader.h

signet comes with two library modules, *sha1* and *verifytrust*.  The *sha1* module provides
an open source sha1 calculator. It's inclusion removes the dependency of bundling openssl
with your loader. The *verifytrust* modules provides windows pe verification.

How It works
------------

The default loader is a two pass system, with each pass creating a separate
instance of python.  The first pass performs verification, and the second pass
runs the target script. 

The two pass architecture was to solve the fact that the loader wants to scan
the modules in alphabectical order (which is required for security). But
importing modules alphabetically does not allow modules to initialize
themselves in the way their designers may have intended. So after the first
pass finishes validation, we finalize the fist pass python and initialize an
new instance.


Import Side-effects
+++++++++++++++++++

The two pass solution has one draw back, namely *import sidee-ffects*. First, let me
say **import sideeffects are evil** ! Imported code should stick to strictly initializing
its internal state. Imported code should NOT connect to databases, the Internet, make
changes to the filesystem nor should it output to the console. Code that needs to do
these things should wait until the user specifically requests initialization.

If your code has import side-effects, then it's up to you to make sure the side-effects
are harmless during signet's pass one validation phase. At a minimum, you need to ensure
it's safe to run these side-effects twice.
